# Hotel Booking Site Documentation

## NavBar
The **NavBar** is a dark strip located at the top of every webpage.  
It consists of two key components:
1. **Hotel**: Redirects the user to the homepage.
2. **User**: This component dynamically updates based on user authentication:
   - If the user is not signed in, it displays "Sign In."
   - If the user is signed in, it shows the username of the logged-in user.
